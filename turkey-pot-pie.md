After Thanksgiving, we were looking at a mountain of leftover turkey and were wondering what to do with it.  I've never cooked pot pies before, but I found a recipe online and tweaked it with what we had in the cupboard.  I was nervous the first time I cooked and hoped I did a good job.

See, my mother-in-law was over when I cooked the recipe for the first time.  She's a pot pie aficionado and regularly orders the same pot pie from one of her favorite restaurants.  During dinner, she took the first bite of the first Westchester Pot Pie ever. Worried, I asked her, "Is it good?  Should I change anything?".  She put down her fork and looked at me with a serious face and said, "This is better than the restaurant's, don't change a thing!"  I guess I did ok after all.

Since then, I've cooked the pot pies whenever we have leftover turkey or chicken.  Next Thanksgiving, I may skip eating whole turkey meat entirely and cook these instead.

This spring, my wife and I were missing our family because of the lockdown.  We decided to cook and deliver pies to them. We even wrote their initials into the pies with a knife before baking them.  Food is a great way to stay connected, and Westchester Pot Pie is now a tradition for us.  We joke around when eating it and ask if we should change anything.  The answer is always, "Don't change a thing!"

Cooked with the Thanksgiving alpha turkey and again with leftovers.  The recipe was amazing.

The original recipes cooks two pot pies. I've only cooked either one pie or three so the ratios may be a bit off.  I'd spice to taste and thicken slowly.

We removed the onions from the original because I have a hard time with them and the green beans and peas because we didn't have any. Going to the store the day before Thanksgiving is not an ideal experience.

Ingredients
- 1 cup canned peas
- 1 cup chopped carrots
- 1/3 cup butter
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder 
- 1 teaspoon celery seed
- 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme, cracked rosemary)
 * I use the Italian seasoning was a Penzeys "Italian Herb" mix.  Each spice is about an 1/8th of a teaspoon or pinch if you want to make your own.
- 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
- 2/3 cups milk
- 2 cups cubed cooked turkey or chicken - a mix of light and dark meat makes it better
- 2 (9 inch) unbaked pie crusts

Directions
 1. Place the peas and carrots into a saucepan; cover with water, bring to a boil, and simmer over medium-low heat until the celery is tender, about 8 minutes. Drain the vegetables in a colander set in the sink, and set aside.
 2. Combine the broth and milk with the butter, salt, black pepper, celery seed, and Italian seasoning; slowly whisk in the flour and milk until the mixture comes to a simmer and thickens. 
 3. Keep mixture on the low heat until the mixture thickens into a filling.  You can add more flour to speed up the process.  Remove mixture from heat; stir the cooked vegetables and turkey meat into the filling until well combined.
 4. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
 5. Place a pie crust on the bottom of a 9-inch pie dishes. Spoon the filling into the pie crust, then cover the filling with the other crust.  You could have a little leftover filling, that's ok. Pinch and roll the top and bottom crusts together at the edge of each pie to seal, and cut several small slits into the top of the pies with a sharp knife to release steam.
 6. Bake in the preheated oven until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. If the crusts are browning too quickly, cover the pies with aluminum foil after about 15 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
