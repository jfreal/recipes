Egg roll in a bowl ramen

1 pound lean ground beef
1 cup sweet onion
3/4 cup shredded carrots
Tsp. of ginger (grated)
3 cloves minced garlic
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 cup green cabbage
1 cup purple cabbage
1 oz of soy sauce (reduced sodium)
2 tsp of rice vinegar
Sea salt to taste
Pepper to taste
1 tsp. Sesame oil
Green onions chopped to sprinkle over pan
2 blocks of cooked ramen
Sesame seeds for garnish

Bang bang sauce to drizzle over dish:
1/2 cup of nonfat Greek yogurt
4 tsps of honey
4 tsps of sriracha
1 tsp of rice vinegar

Directions: On stove top - cook your hamburger over medium heat and half way through doneness, add your onions and sauté until they soften. Add your carrots, garlic, ginger and chicken broth and sauté for a few minutes. Then add your green and red cabbage and add a cover to the top of the pan to help soften the cabbage so it’s easier to mix with the rest of the ingredients. Once this is complete, add your soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sea salt and pepper and your 2 blocks of cooked ramen. Mix for a couple of minutes until all is combined. Then add your green onions, bang bang sauce and sesame seeds to top of your dish as garnishment. Enjoy!

This is as close measurement wise as I could get to the grams and ml. I hope it helps!
