## Ingredients
 - ½ cup unsalted butter room temperature
 - ¾ cup light brown sugar
 - ¼ cup white sugar
 - 1 large egg
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 2 cups all purpose flour
 - ½ tsp salt
 - ½ tsp baking powder
 - ¾ cup semi sweet chocolate chips 

## Instructions
 - Line a large baking sheet with a silicone baking mat, set aside.
 - In a large mixing bowl add the butter and sugars. Using a hand or stand mixer cream the butter and sugars together until fluffy.
 - Add in the large egg, vanilla and mix until combined.
 - Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix until combined. The dough might seem to be in crumbles as mentioned above.
 - Pour in the chocolate chips and pecans (if using) and use your hands to mix them in. This will bring the dough together. Be gentle though. We don't want to compact the dough too much. We want to keep it as airy as possible.
 - Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Gently form into cookie form. Place on the baking sheet.
 - Chill the cookie dough for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 during this time.
 - Bake the cookies for about 16-18 minutes. The outside will be golden brown. (cook longer in our oven)
 - Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for at least 5 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to continue cooling. The cookies need to cool prior to serving. They are best at room temperature.

## Notes
Make ahead tip: You can make the cookie dough and keep it chilled in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months sealed in a freezer bag.
Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months, freeze them on a baking sheet first for a few hours, then add to a freezer bag to store. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw
